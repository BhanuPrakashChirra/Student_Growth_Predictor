# Student Growth Predictor

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict student growth based on various academic and demographic factors. By leveraging machine learning models, we can identify patterns and provide insights into student performance trajectories, helping educators and institutions to implement targeted interventions and support systems.

## Project Explanation

The Student Growth Predictor is designed to analyze historical student data to forecast future academic performance. It utilizes a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify key factors that influence student growth. The project is particularly useful for educational institutions looking to implement data-driven strategies to enhance student outcomes.

## Features

*   **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean, transform, and prepare raw student data for model training.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Methods to create relevant features from existing data, enhancing model accuracy.
*   **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various regression and classification models to predict student growth.
*   **Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to assess the performance of the trained models.
*   **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to present predicted growth and key influencing factors.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student_Growth_Predictor.git
    cd Student_Growth_Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your data**: Ensure your student data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2.  **Run the preprocessing scripts**: Execute the scripts to clean and prepare your data.
3.  **Train the model**: Run the main script to train the prediction model.
4.  **Make predictions**: Use the trained model to predict student growth for new data.
5.  **Analyze results**: Interpret the model's output and visualizations.

    Example:
    ```bash
    python main.py --mode train
    python main.py --mode predict --input_file new_student_data.csv
    ```
